## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, 1}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r 2, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  

These results have also been observed before in the literature [@Hall:1985; @Affl:etal:2005].  Many moons ago, @Turk:Bork:2005 showed that using R Markdown will save you a huge amount of time.
